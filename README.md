# rollingDownPlay
mobile application

This project is not finish yet and here you can get only the game files. No scripts and assets is here. 
To get scripts files go to my another repository "rollingDown". 
But you can view or play as a sample/demo of the game. 
You have to play it on windows. Download the files and open the "exe" file.
